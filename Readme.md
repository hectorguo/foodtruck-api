## APIs

The APIs are consistent with [Yelp's Fusion API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search), but it focuses on searching food trucks.

### 1. Authentication

By posting this request, you will get a `access_token` and `token_type`.
Please attach the two parameters into HTTP Headers when you send a `GET` request for searching food trucks.

#### Request

```
POST /foodtrucks/auth
```

#### Sample

```
POST https://jirv8u2ell.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev/foodtrucks/auth
```

**Response Body**

```json
{
    "access_token": "UOG4x25kRFF6bWtb-Sq8wP2J3mD9NZfSKbKdweHWO0nC7C-A5-ROuVH30RQ7_2tQrYpIAvOuIjI9OBtON8BtUb49la3UGXmc0B_tgTddC14pp0ceMTSHY_xxnyhtWXYx",
    "expires_in": 15270710,
    "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

### 2. Search Food Trucks

Search food trucks by city or geolocation.

#### Request

```
GET /foodtrucks/search
```

**Search Parameters**

Name | Data Type | Required / Optional | Description
---------|----------|---------|---------
location | string	| Required | if either latitude or longitude is not provided. Specifies the combination of "address, neighborhood, city, state or zip, optional country" to be used when searching for businesses.
latitude | decimal	| Required | if location is not provided. Latitude of the location you want to search nearby.
longitude | decimal	| Required | if location is not provided. Longitude of the location you want to search nearby.
radius | int	| Optional |  Search radius in meters. If the value is too large, a AREA_TOO_LARGE error may be returned. The max value is 40000 meters (25 miles).
categories | string	| Optional |  Categories to filter the search results with. See the list of supported categories. The category filter can be a list of comma delimited categories. For example, "bars,french" will filter by Bars and French. The category identifier should be used (for example "discgolf", not "Disc Golf").
locale | string	| Optional |  Specify the locale to return the business information in. See the list of supported locales.
limit | int	| Optional |  Number of business results to return. By default, it will return 20. Maximum is 50.
offset | int	| Optional |  Offset the list of returned business results by this amount.
sort_by | string	| Optional |  Sort the results by one of the these modes: best_match, rating, review_count or distance. By default it's best_match. The rating sort is not strictly sorted by the rating value, but by an adjusted rating value that takes into account the number of ratings, similar to a bayesian average. This is so a business with 1 rating of 5 stars doesnâ€™t immediately jump to the top.
price | string	| Optional |  Pricing levels to filter the search result with: 1 = $, 2 = $$, 3 = $$$, 4 = $$$$. The price filter can be a list of comma delimited pricing levels. For example, "1, 2, 3" will filter the results to show the ones that are $, $$, or $$$.
open_now | boolean	| Optional |  Default to false. When set to true, only return the businesses open now. Notice that open_at and open_now cannot be used together.
open_at | int	| Optional |  An integer represending the Unix time in the same timezone of the search location. If specified, it will return business open at the given time. Notice that open_at and open_now cannot be used together.
attributes | string	| Optional |  Additional filters to restrict search results. Possible values are: <ul><li>**hot_and_new** - Hot and New businesses</li> <li>**request_a_quote** - Businesses that have the Request a Quote feature</li> <li>**waitlist_reservation** - Businesses that have an online waitlist</li> <li>**cashback** - Businesses that offer Cash Back</li> <li>**deals** - Businesses that offer Deals</li> <li>**gender_neutral_restrooms** - Businesses that provide gender neutral restrooms.</li></ul>  You can combine multiple attributes by providing a comma separated like "attribute1,attribute2". If multiple attributes are used, only businesses that satisfy ALL attributes will be returned in search results. For example, the attributes "hot_and_new,cashback" will return businesses that are Hot and New AND offer Cash Back.
